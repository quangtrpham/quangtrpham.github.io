# JARS MONEY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Link demo: https://quangtrpham.github.io/index.html

I built this website with the purpose of helping users to calculate how much money should be saved from their income. I applied JARS money management system of T. Harv Eker to divide the savings into 6 parts.

### How it works?
All you need is just enter the amount you want to save. The system will calculate and divide your amount into 6 parts.

### What are those 6 parts?

#### #1: Basic necessities (55% of your budget)
Money in this jar is intended for covering daily expenses and paying bills. It will also cover your costs for rent, transport, taxes and food.

#### #2: Private reserves (10% of your budget)
These savings can be used for large purchases. Spend this money when you want to buy a flat screen TV, an annual gym membership, or a car. This is your reserve fund that you should constantly replenish.

#### #3: Long-term savings (10% of your budget)
This is a guarantee for your future financial independence. You'll use money from this jar for investing and creating passive income sources. You shouldn't spend these savings until you get complete financial freedom. And even in this case, it's better to spend only the interest that you receive from these savings and not the savings itself.

#### #4: Education (10% of your budget)
Money in this jar is intended to further your education and personal growth. Investing is a great way of allocating money, and you are the most valuable asset. Always keeps that in mind. Use this money to buy books, educational CDs, or courses - it will pay off later.

#### #5: Entertainment (10% of your budget)
You can spend this part of your budget for purchases that you don't buy regularly. For example, you can buy a bottle of expensive wine or go somewhere for vacation. Spend this money as you wish!

#### #6: Charity and gifts (5% of your budget)
Spend this money when you need to buy gifts for birthdays, weddings, and other celebrations. You can also donate this money to cancer aid associations, animal shelters, or just people who need help.
